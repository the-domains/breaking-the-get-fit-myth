We don't just want to lose weight. We all have this misconception that as long as the scale is subtracting numbers we're doing good. Shows like The Biggest Loser are notorious for shoving this in people's faces. Which oddly enough scandals are slowly slipping out about their terrible behind the scenes practices. With trainers having them go beyond the health boundaries into unsafe weight loss practices from popping pills, telling them to starve themselves, over working their bodies, throwing up etc. This is not ok. We need to bust this weight loss myth once and for all.

Are entire goal is to lose FAT. Not just weight. Your primary weight you can lose includes water, muscle and fat. We want to rid our bodies of excess water and fat we're walking around with. Science shows that the more muscle you have the higher rate of fat we are able to burn. So if you want to really lose that fat we have to get those muscles active and growing! This is absolutely crucial. 

Generally during the beginning stages of burning this fat off we are able to not only see it on our bodies disappearing quickly but also on the scale. Where we run into some disappointment is when we don't see the scale drop for a few days are we see that we actually gained weight!?! What??? I thought I was doing everything right?! Ah! But you are! Muscle weighs more than fat! You starting to exercise will wake those muscles up and enough use your muscle will then begin to grow. Referring to the picture above you can see that the two weigh the same but the amount of space varies greatly between the two. This leads to that confusion on the scale. You may not be able to see the muscle but it's there. 

This is why I have a problem with those "weight loss" shows. Someone may go up a pound and now they're resorting to those terrible practices to try and get them to cut weight. When in REALITY they're losing the bad fat and building muscle. Them going into those bad practices only hurts the body again longterm and is detrimental to the actual muscle growth. Again like we clarified the more muscle the more fat you are going to burn! So when you're hitting that weigh in and you know you've stuck to your exercises and proper eating habits hitting your macros especially just know you're on the right path if that number plateaus or slightly goes up. Don't lose faith!
