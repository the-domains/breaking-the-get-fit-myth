Muscle weighs more than fat! You starting to exercise will wake those muscles up and enough use your muscle will then begin to grow. Referring to the picture above you can see that the two weigh the same but the amount of space varies greatly between the two. This leads to that confusion on the scale.

So when you're hitting that weigh in and you know you've stuck to your exercises and proper eating habits hitting your macros especially just know you're on the right path if that number plateaus or slightly goes up.
