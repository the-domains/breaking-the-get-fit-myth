description: "For a lot of us who haven't exercised in a while or maybe even ever we're just unsure of where to start and that can be intimidating. The biggest thing to understand is that you can't compare yourself to anyone else. Your focus is YOU and improving YOU. Take it day by day and CHECK YOUR EGO AT THE DOOR. Being honest with yourself and not trying to Hulk out on exercises with too much weight is going to lead you to strain and injure yourself as well as leading to you being insanely sore. Which is not going to be enjoyable and will act as a negative reinforcement and association with exercise which we want you to enjoy! "

For a lot of us who haven't exercised in a while or maybe even ever we're just unsure of where to start and that can be intimidating. The biggest thing to understand is that you can't compare yourself to anyone else. Your focus is YOU and improving YOU. Take it day by day and CHECK YOUR EGO AT THE DOOR. Being honest with yourself and not trying to Hulk out on exercises with too much weight is going to lead you to strain and injure yourself as well as leading to you being insanely sore. Which is not going to be enjoyable and will act as a negative reinforcement and association with exercise which we want you to enjoy! 

Exercising isn't only going to help you lose that unwanted fat, but is also helping your body move which promotes it's healing. If you're not moving enough your body is not able to push nutrients to where they need to be and you can't heal properly. You will also see a jump in your overall mental clarity and energy. Not to mention if you are overweight you'll start easing that back and joint pain that you've been walking around with. 

Ok so where do you start?

Well that all depends first on your level of health. Like we said before we want to give ourselves a subtle intro best for our bodies. So where are you at?

* Not active, mostly just sitting down all day wether at work or home. 

* Some activity, sitting down quiet frequently, but also getting in a 3-5 thousand steps in a day

* Active with with work and maybe walking at least a mile or just under a day.

* Very active with work, walking/running and maybe exercising with weights or yoga. Some type of strength and resistance training at least 2-3 times per week.

* Highly active working out 3-5 times a week
