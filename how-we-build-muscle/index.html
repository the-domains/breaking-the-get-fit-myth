The key component is Protein. The building blocks of that broken down to your muscle consist of Branch Chained Amino Acids (BCAA's for short) which are leucine, isoleucine and valine. </p><p>A lot of us may have heard of protein shakes and taking them for post workout. This helps repair and aid in building new muscle. But what we may not understand is how to best optimize this process to almost zero out the recovery time and build as much muscle in the same time. With the aid of protein and a few other key components we can have incredible results. First and foremost quality is KING. You put in mediocre ingredients you'll get the same mediocre results. No different than the general food you consume. You are what you eat. </p><p>To properly explain the process i've decided to take 1st Phorm's example they use to really simply things and absolutely nail the entire process...</p><p>"Flying solo with protein only after a workout means that your body will very slowly digest this protein, convert most of it into glucose and push it into the cell as glycogen. That translates into a lot of wasted time, effort, and money on your part and leaves no protein in the end to build and repair with since it has all been converted into glycogen. The time and effort that your body could be recovering or building muscle is spent with remedial digestive tasks; money you’ve spent on proteins is essentially wasted in the conversion process. In addition to a whey isolate, you should always consume a fast absorbing carbohydrate that spikes your insulin levels to replenish glycogen stores and take full advantage of the proteins you are taking. Glycogen is your body’s carbohydrate stores that serve essentially as your on-board battery. Training with weights severely depletes your glycogen stores and drains the battery. We all know how pumped we get in the gym and how great we feel when we walk out, but we all also know about that “flat” feeling we get about an hour later after the pump wears off. That “flat” feeling is from a lack of glycogen in the muscle – you used it all up at the gym and your body is scrambling to take every-thing you throw at it to fill them back up again. </p><p>Your body is programmed to address this issue first when you walk out of the gym. It does not care about building muscle or burning fat—its focus is on charging that battery back-up. Building muscle and burning fat aren’t essential for survival, having the proper amount of glycogen on-board is. Your body is programmed for survival first and that’s what it's going to take care of, replenishing glycogen. Until that’s taken care of you can forget about your body repairing and rebuilding muscle. Ignition is pure dexanhydrous glucose. There is not a form of carbohydrates anywhere known to man that is more pure or refined or that can deliver glycogen directly to the muscles any faster. It literally will ignite muscle growth by replenishing your glycogen stores immediately and spiking your insulin levels to allow maximum protein assimilation. In a nutshell, it creates an optimal environment for recovery and protein synthesis.Insulin is a hormone in your body and if you harness it’s power correctly and at the right times, it will lead to explosive muscle growth. Insulin is, for all intents and purposes, the key that unlocks your cell to allow proteins into it. When an insulin spike occurs, the muscle cell doors open to allow your body to absorb protein. In doing so you are able to retain and utilize a much higher percentage of protein by pushing it straight into the muscle cell for conversion."</p><p>Whey protein is the industry standard for post workout, but what a majority of the companies do is process these key protein components at very high temperatures. Which actually takes away from the full potential of these proteins. To use a simple analogy think about grilling a piece of chicken on the grill. If you cook it with too high of heat what happens? You burn and char it. Now is there some protein left in there to digest? Sure, but nowhere to the degree or quality of what it could have if cooked at the right temperature. You want low temperature processed hydrolyzed whey protein. Hydrolyzed is just where the protein is broken down smaller making it easy to mix without leaving chunks of grit and allowing for faster breakdown in the body. 1st Phorm has the top of the line whey protein on the market designed specifically for this reason. </p><p>Also having a protein shake before bed can really help your recovery as well as promoting lean muscle growth. Especially if you are doing very high intense training. Casein protein or even better taking a product of higher quality such as Level-1 gives you a sustained release which mimics the protein assimilation rates of whole food. This ensures that your body while it is asleep is still getting nutrients to you need and not throwing on any unnecessary weight (fat storage).
