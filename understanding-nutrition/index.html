Have great success in those first weeks? Probably. Did it last? Probably not. Why? Because current diet fads are all set up for short term results and not set for longevity. Our society and culture have bent our perception of instant gratification and just telling us, if the scale is showing lower numbers we're healthy. NOT TRUE. The key to attaining true health and fitness is by truly understanding the best ways for optimizing our bodies functions with nutrition and exercise.</p><p>Now if you think about it in basic terms your nutrition is your fuel. No one puts unleaded gas in a Ferrari. Because the engine has to operate at the absolute highest performance it can. You don't want to spend $100,000 on a car for it to end up running like a 97' Ford Taurus right? The quality of nutrients you put in your body are the literal building blocks your body uses to repair and build itself and effect every aspect. Without the proper supplementation your body goes unattended which leads to illnesses and injuries wether they be short term or long term and range from minor to severe. We all have the opportunity to have the bodies we've always wanted we just need to tweak a few minor habits and you'll be amazed at what you're actually capable of.</p><p>UNDERSTANDING PROPER NUTRITION</p><p>For starters lets understand that counting calories and restricting your intake of them to extremely low levels actually hurts your body. It sends your body literally into a sort of survival mode to start storing energy. This same response is sent to the fat, so it stays. The results you see are from you just withering away. Calories are defined as: the energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water through 1 °C. The honest truth is that the amount of calories really doesn't matter. It's where those calories come from and what they're made of that matter most.</p><p>MACROnutrients </p><p>They are the BIG 4: protein, fats, carbohydrates, and fiber. The science says that with these three properly balanced it helps you properly regulate your body's insulin. Insulin is one of the key components that simply put helps you burn or store fat as well as helping with a lot of key functions your body does internally especially with hormone regulation. So it's safe to say that if this is off wether you are "in shape" or not your body is not working to it's full capacity. By making sure you are well balancing your macros you will see your body start shedding weight. So let's dive into how to best optimize these.</p><ul><li>Protein (specifically amino acids) are the building blocks of new muscle tissue. An overall protein intake of 35% of your overall caloric intake for Low-Carb Days and 30% for High-Carb Days is recommended when dieting to optimize body composition. Split your protein up evenly across 3-6 meals(completely up to you how you want to go with this pending your lifestyle). </li></ul><ul><li>Fat contains 9 calories per gram o Fat is an essential macronutrient used in the production of hormones and the construction of cellular membranes (amongst many other things) An overall fat intake of 25% of your overall caloric intake for Low-Carb Days and 20% for High-Carb Days is recommended when dieting to optimize body composition.</li></ul><ul><li>Carbohydrates (specifically stored muscle glycogen) are the primary fuel source in resistance training . An overall carbohydrate intake of 40% of your overall caloric intake for Low-Carb Days and 50% for High-Carb Days is recommended when dieting to optimize body composition.</li></ul><ul><li>Fiber provides the proper push and content to waste in the intestines and promotes healthy gastrointestinal functioning. Adults should aim for a diet that contains 30 g to 35 g of fiber per day. Too much could result in too many visits to the bathroom and too little will cause constipation. </li></ul><p>MICROnutrients </p><p>Never heard of these? That's ok a lot of people haven't and also unfortunately are not getting them in their existing diets or at the quality needed to be effective. The CDC (Center for Disease Control) defines micronutrients as: "dietary components, often referred to as vitamins and minerals, which although only required by the body in small amounts, are vital to development, disease prevention, and wellbeing. Micronutrients are not produced in the body and must be derived from the diet."</p><p>The CDC also states that, "deficiencies in micronutrients such as iron, iodine, vitamin A, folate and zinc can have devastating consequences. At least half of children worldwide ages 6 months to 5 years suffer from one or more micronutrient deficiency, and globally more than 2 billion people are affected." We aren't just talking about 3rd world countries we're talking about GLOBALLY, are you one of them? Having the proper micronutrients in your diet especially if not implemented already can have incredible results for your over all health and a key component in a fully functioning mind and body! So be sure to get those in! (see our recommended supplements page for high quality supplements you can easily implement into your regular diet)</p><p>HOW DO I IMPLEMENT THIS INTO MY EVERYDAY LIFESTYLE?</p><p>The key to using this information is simply by planning, turning this from a "diet" into a healthy overall lifestyle. We want you to lose the unhealthy weight (fat) and be able to keep it off without losing muscle and hurting your body longterm with these quick short dieting habits that don't give you the success you want two months after. Also to track your meals and progress download the app MyFitnessPal. It has the largest library of foods and drink breakdowns that you can easily track and make sure you're on point with your daily goal.</p><p>Meal Plan. Have a set schedule of meals for the week you can cook for that you like and fall within your perimeters of macros. Preferably do the grocery shopping Saturday/Sunday and cook Sunday so you're ready with your meals for work on Monday. This helps you save money not eating out all the time (bonus) and keeps you organized not having to resort to eating fast food for lunch because it's easy. </p><p>Also PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE research what is in your food and drinks whatever they maybe. The more organic and farm market fresh the better! Processed foods have way too many preservatives that are aiding store water and fat in the body as well as linked to some very serious diseases like cancer. Sad fact of it is that not all food is created equal. Like we said in the beginning your body uses everything you put in it to rebuild itself. The human body every 7 years is essentially rebuilt and the foundation of that is what you eat! Quality counts!</p><p><br/></p><p>The simple fact is that if you look at your day and stop making excuses for not having enough "time" or energy. Honestly look at your week and start writing down how much time you'r spending on certain things and you will surely know how much time you could divert into taking your health seriously. That 3 hours of Netflix aafter work you can do without. Devote that time to actually helping yourself at least an hour. Time is going to pass regardless of what you do. So why not using it to actually benefit your health. </p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-local " data-reactid="32"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="34"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="35"><span data-reactid="36"><!-- react-empty: 37 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="38"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="39">Understanding Nutrition </a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="40"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="41"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="42"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
